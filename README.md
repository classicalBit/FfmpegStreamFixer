# ffmpeg_stream_sorter

ffmpeg_stream_sorter is a Python script designed to manipulate MKV video files, focusing on reordering audio and subtitle streams based on user-defined priorities, optionally adding subtitles, converting audio codecs, and organizing completed files.

You just downloaded Anime MKV files or other MKV files and want to quickly rename them, sort audio and/or subtitle streams and change default flags of these files? You maybe want to add an SRT file simultaniously? And on top of that convert specific audio stream codecs and define their bitrate?
